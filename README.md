🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Superstore Sales Prediction Using Time Series Analysis! 📈
I've recently completed a project where I utilized time series analysis to predict sales for a retail superstore. The project involved data preprocessing, model building, and visualization using Python.
🔍 Key Highlights:
Data Processing: Cleaned and prepared the data, handling missing values and converting dates into a proper datetime format.
Modeling: Employed the ARIMA model to forecast future sales based on historical data. ARIMA was chosen for its effectiveness in capturing trends and patterns in time series data.
Evaluation: Achieved insightful predictions with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 6261646.16. This provided a clear understanding of the model’s accuracy.
Visualization: Plotted the predicted sales against actual sales, which allowed for a visual comparison and deeper insights.
🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Statsmodels for implementing the ARIMA model
Scikit-learn for evaluating the model
📊 What I Learned:
This project deepened my understanding of time series analysis and its practical applications in business forecasting. It also enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, model fitting, and interpreting model outputs.
Feel free to check out the project details and code [here] (add a link to your GitHub repository or a blog post if available).
Looking forward to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts and hearing your thoughts!
